## Build:

We&rsquo;re going with the following existing tools to aid in development:
* [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) gem for our user authentication
* [Rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails) for testing
* [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) database for seamless deployment to Heroku later
* [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) gem for management of environment variables to keep sensitive authentication tokens and keys out of the main git tracked code base.
